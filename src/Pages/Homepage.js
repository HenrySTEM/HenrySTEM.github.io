            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> 
                I am currently an eighth grader at Detroit Country Day school. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy doing competition math and competative programming. I am also interested in theoretical math. I also enjoy solving math and logic puzzles, and I post very frequently 
                on the math website <a href="artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/404771" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Competative Math Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have a lot of experience with competition math. I am a two-time national Mathcounts qualifier (6th and 8th grade, as 7th grade Mathcounts was 
                canceled due to COVID-19). I am also a USAJMO qualifier and a three-time AIME qualifier. I have also received the distinguished honor roll (top 1%)
                for the AMC 10.
            </p>

            <h2>Competative Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have done competative programming for about a year. I am a specialist on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/JiangSTEM">CodeForces</a>, and 
                also have an account on <a href="https://leetcode.com/HenrySTEM/">LeetCode</a>. However, as of now, I am not particularly active in the competative 
                programming community.
            </p>
