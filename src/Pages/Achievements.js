            <h2>Math Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have a lot of experience with competition math. I am a two-time national Mathcounts qualifier (6th and 8th grade, as 7th grade Mathcounts was 
                canceled due to COVID-19). I am also a USAJMO qualifier and a three-time AIME qualifier. I have also received the distinguished honor roll (top 1%)
                for the AMC 10.
            </p>

            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have done competative programming for about a year. I am a specialist on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/JiangSTEM">CodeForces</a>, and 
                also have an account on <a href="https://leetcode.com/HenrySTEM/">LeetCode</a>. However, as of now, I am not particularly active in the competative 
                programming community.
            </p>

                Currently, there are not many important projects I have done. They will appear here once I do them (and I plan to do one pretty soon).
